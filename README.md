WORKING TITLE: SPRYTZ FLIGHT

This is a simple scrolling game i created using Apple’s XCode software
and mostly written in Swift / Objective-C.
The game was successfully published in the app store in September 2015.

The game was designed to be very simple with regards the controls and gameplay,
but particularly challenging in relation to gameplay difficulty and point scoring

The intent was to create a short burst game where players would have
several goes at beating high scores in short succession.

There was a lot of promotional content surrounding the game and
competitions were put on for the highest scorers in local areas.

The game was linked to Apples Game Centre which kept a database of peoples scores.

There was a lot of interest in the first few months of it’s release.
Unfortunately the game had to be pulled from the app store when Apple changed
their policy on their built in advertising.

I haven’t revisited the game since...
...one day i definitely will!
